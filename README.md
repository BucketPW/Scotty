Screenshot utility for pomf.se.
Rewrite from an earlier version I made while I was still attending Rijn IJssel, similar in function as puu.sh but very minimal RAM usage. 

<b>Usage:</b><br/>
<ul>
  <li>PrtSc for regular screenshots.</li>
  <li>Ctrl + PrtSc for a area selection screenshot.</li>
  <li>Url to the screenshot will be in your clipboard after, just press Ctrl + V to paste.</li>
</ul>
